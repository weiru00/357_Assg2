# Smart Home IoT with Google Cloud VM and MQTT

This project demonstrates how to connect a smart home system equipped with an IR sensor, rain sensor, and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to Google Cloud Virtual Machine (VM) instances via MQTT. The system aims to provide real-time environmental monitoring and control within a smart home environment, leveraging the power of cloud computing for data analysis and storage.

## System Overview
The smart home system includes the following components:

IR Sensor: Detects motion and presence within the home environment.
Rain Sensor: Monitors weather conditions, specifically the occurrence of rain.
DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity levels indoors.
MQTT Protocol: Facilitates communication between IoT devices and the Google Cloud VM, ensuring efficient and secure data transmission.
Google Cloud VM Instance: Hosts the MQTT broker and processes incoming data for analysis, storage, based on sensor readings.
MongoDB: Stores the incoming data. 

## Hardware Components
Microcontroller (Cytron Maker Feather AIoT S3), Infrared Sensor, Rain Sensor, DHT11 Sensor, LED, Servo Motor, Relay, Buzzer, Breadboard, DC motor with fan blade, Jumpers.
